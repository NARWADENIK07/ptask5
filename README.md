Module 6: Data Structures and Strings in Python

Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

A dictionary my_dict stores student names and their marks.
The user is prompted to enter a student's name.
The program checks if the entered name exists in the dictionary:

If it exists, it prints the student's name and marks.
If not, it prints "Student not found". 

Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 

A list my_list with numbers 1 to 10 is created.
The first 5 elements are extracted and stored in k.
The list k is reversed in place.

The original list, extracted elements, and reversed elements are printed.
